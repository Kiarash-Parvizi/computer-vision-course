# Arabic Digit Classifier using Neural Networks (ANN and CNN)
### Introduction
This project aims to develop and compare two types of neural network architectures, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for the task of Arabic digit classification. The classifiers are trained on a labeled dataset of handwritten Arabic digits to learn patterns and features that enable accurate classification.


### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Arabic Handwritten Digits
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mloey1/ahdd1), which contains
a collection of images representing handwritten Arabic digits in grayscale.
Data augmentation was also used in order to help the model achieve better accuracy
